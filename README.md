My name is Brayden Kutch and I am a senior at Indiana University Bloomington. My major is informatics with a minor in financial literacy and a cognate in business. I am from a small town outside of Terre Haute, Indiana. After college, I have plans to work at a real estate brokerage specializing in residential and commercial real estate.
